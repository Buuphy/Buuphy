## Challenges
NOTE: You should be able to complete all challenges in about 2 to 3 hours. The lab is intentionally made to be done in one go. If you power off the VM and power it back on, certain challenges (specifically challenges 6, 10, 11, and 12) will not work properly as they depend on running services.
